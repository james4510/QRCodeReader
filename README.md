# Church Inventory Management System

This is a web-based inventory management system designed for churches to keep track of items by generating and scanning QR codes. It helps you manage church equipment and assets, including details like item ID, manager, department, borrow date, and the current status of the item (borrowed or returned).

## Features

- Add new items to the database with relevant details such as item name, manager, department, borrow date, and borrow status.
- Automatically generate a QR code for each item, which can be scanned to view item details.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI built with Bootstrap for ease of use.
- QR code generation with real-time URL pointing to the item details page.
- Item details page with comprehensive information such as manager, department, and borrow status.
